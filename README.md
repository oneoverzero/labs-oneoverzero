Migration from wordpress completed a while ago

:)
git submodule init
git submodule update
hugo server


Site was build and is supposed to work with Hugo version 0.56.0 (linux x86_64), which is now bundled within the website

Deploy is now prepared to be hosted with Github Pages, following instructions from here:
https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/

(I was forced to specify the final https:// URL in both build and deploy in order for everything to work properly)
